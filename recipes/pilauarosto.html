   <h2>Steps</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>Prepare the Rice: Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
       <li>Cook the Spices: Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and cook until golden brown, stirring occasionally.</li>
       <li>Add Aromatics: Add the minced garlic, ginger, and green chilies (if using). Cook for about 2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
       <li>Add Spices: Stir in the pilau masala, ground coriander, ground turmeric, and ground cumin. Cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
       <li>Cook Tomatoes: Add the chopped tomatoes and cook until they soften and blend with the spices.</li>
       <li>Add Rice and Broth: Add the drained rice to the pot and stir well to coat with the spice mixture. Pour in the broth or water, and add salt to taste. Bring to a boil.</li>
       <li>Simmer: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let it simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the rice is cooked and the liquid is absorbed. Do not uncover the pot during this time.</li>
       <li>Fluff and Serve: Once cooked, fluff the rice with a fork and set aside.</li>
       <li>Marinate the Meat: In a bowl, combine the meat chunks with vegetable oil, minced garlic, ginger, ground coriander, ground cumin, paprika, black pepper, pilau masala, salt, and lemon juice. Mix well to coat the meat. Let it marinate for at least 30 minutes, or overnight in the refrigerator for best results.</li>
       <li>Roast the Meat: Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F). Spread the marinated meat on a roasting pan. Add the sliced onions on top.</li>
       <li>Cook: Roast the meat in the preheated oven for about 1 to 1.5 hours, or until the meat is tender and browned, turning occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
       <li>Serve: Serve the roasted meat alongside the pilau rice.</li>
   </ol>
