    <h2>Jollof Rice: A West African Culinary Gem</h2>
    <p>Jollof rice is a delicacy that began in West Africa, but because of frequent cultural exchange amongst various regions, the recipe continues to spread far and wide. It is considered a celebratory dish and popular in West African nations like Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal.</p>
    <p>Because there are so many variations, this jollof rice recipe is probably a combination of a lot of different interpretations.  There are ongoing debates across West Africa that argue which region prepares the best version of jollof rice.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups long-grain parboiled rice</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 inch ginger, minced</li>
        <li>1 red bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup tomato puree</li>
        <li>1/2 cup tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth (or water)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons thyme</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 cups mixed vegetables (carrots, peas, green beans)</li>
        <li>1 pound chicken, cooked and shredded (optional)</li>
        <li>Fresh parsley or cilantro, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Rice: Rinse the rice under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the Base: Heat the vegetable oil in a large pot over medium heat.
            Add the chopped onions and saut√© until translucent, about 5 minutes.
            Add the minced garlic and ginger, and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add Peppers and Tomato: Stir in the chopped red and green bell peppers, and cook for another 5 minutes.
            Add the tomato puree and tomato paste. Cook for about 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomato reduces and loses its raw taste.</li>
        <li>Season the Base: Add the thyme, curry powder, smoked paprika, bay leaves, salt, and pepper.
            Mix well to combine all the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Incorporate Rice:</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice to the pot, stirring to coat the rice with the tomato mixture.
            Pour in the chicken broth (or water) and bring to a boil.</li>
        <li>Simmer: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and simmer for 20-25 minutes.
            Check occasionally and stir to prevent sticking, adding a bit more water or broth if necessary.</li>
        <li>Add Vegetables and Protein: After the rice is cooked, stir in the mixed vegetables and cooked chicken (if using).
            Cover and cook for another 5-10 minutes, until the vegetables are tender and the flavors are well combined.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Serve: Remove the bay leaves and discard them.
            Fluff the rice with a fork, garnish with freshly chopped parsley or cilantro, and serve hot</li>
    </ol>
